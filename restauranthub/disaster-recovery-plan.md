## Recovery Strategies

### Infrastructure Recovery

**Cloud-First Approach:**
- All systems deployed on AWS with multi-region capability
- Auto-scaling groups for automatic recovery
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) for rapid rebuilding
- Container orchestration with Kubernetes for resilience

**Redundancy Levels:**
- **N+1 Redundancy**: Critical components have at least one backup
- **Geographic Distribution**: Resources spread across multiple availability zones
- **Hot Standby**: Real-time replication for immediate failover
- **Warm Standby**: Pre-provisioned but not actively serving traffic

### Data Recovery Strategy

**Database Recovery:**
- PostgreSQL streaming replication with automatic failover
- Point-in-time recovery capability (PITR)
- Cross-region backup replication
- Regular backup validation and testing

**File Storage Recovery:**
- AWS S3 with versioning enabled
- Cross-region replication
- Lifecycle policies for retention management
- Regular integrity checks

**Cache Recovery:**
- Redis cluster with master-slave replication
- Persistent storage for critical cache data
- Automatic failover and cluster healing
- Cache warming procedures

### Application Recovery

**Service Architecture:**
- Microservices with independent failure domains
- Circuit breakers for graceful degradation
- Auto-scaling based on demand
- Blue-green deployments for zero-downtime updates

**Configuration Management:**
- Centralized configuration with Consul
- Environment-specific configurations
- Configuration versioning and rollback
- Automated configuration deployment

## Backup and Restoration

### Backup Strategy

**Database Backups:**
- **Frequency**: Continuous streaming replication + daily full backups
- **Retention**: 30 days daily, 12 weeks weekly, 12 months monthly
- **Storage**: Encrypted backups in AWS S3 with cross-region replication
- **Validation**: Automated restore testing weekly

**File System Backups:**
- **Application Code**: Git repositories with multiple remotes
- **User Uploads**: Real-time S3 replication
- **Configuration Files**: Stored in version control and configuration management
- **Logs**: Centralized logging with 90-day retention

**System State Backups:**
- **VM Images**: Golden images stored and versioned
- **Container Images**: Docker registry with immutable tags
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform state files backed up
