## 🎯 Pre-Production Deployment Checklist

### Critical Issues to Resolve (MUST FIX)

#### ❌ **Build & Compilation**
- [ ] Fix missing DTO imports in auth module
- [ ] Resolve TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] Ensure all active modules compile successfully
- [ ] Test `npm run build` completes without errors
- [ ] Verify `npm run start` launches successfully

**Current Status**: ❌ **BLOCKING** - Server fails to start due to missing DTOs

**Fix Required**:
```bash
# Check missing DTOs
cd src/modules/auth/dto/
ls -la

# Ensure all imports in auth.controller.ts point to existing files
```

#### ⚠️ **Redis Integration**
- [ ] Implement Redis connection or complete fallback mechanisms
- [ ] Test Redis connectivity and failover scenarios
- [ ] Verify session management works with/without Redis
- [ ] Test token blacklisting functionality
- [ ] Implement Redis health checks

**Current Status**: ⚠️ **DEGRADED** - Fallback mechanisms in place but not optimal
